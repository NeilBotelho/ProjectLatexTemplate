\section{Technologies Used}

\subsection{ReactJS}
ReactJS is a front-end JavaScript library for building reusable User Interface components.  These componentIt provides the View layer in the Model View Controller(MVC) paradigm. It can be used in developing Single Page Applications. React components make it possible to develop large web based applications efficiently. These applications provide better user experience, are interactive and faster because the data can be changed without subsequent page refreshes. 


\subsection{Node.js}
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment. It executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is used by web developers for server side scripting to produce dynamic web page content before sending it to the user. Node.js allows web development around a single programming language by eliminating the need to use programming languages other than JavaScript for backend development. \newline

It has an event-driven architecture that is capable of asynchronous I/O, enabling development of fast web servers in JavasScript. This makes the web application scalable and suitable for real time applications like browser games. Node.js is officially supported on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows 8.1.

\subsection{Python}
Python is a high level, general purpose programming language. It supports multiple programming paradigms including functional and object oriented programming. It was designed for code readability. The formatting is visually uncluttered and uses English keywords. It is one of the most popular programming languages. It allows programmers to write clear and logical code for small as well as large scale projects. \newline

Python source distribution maintains "batteries included philosophy" for having a rich and versatile standard library. This gives Python language a head start in many projects since the developer can start working on the project directly, without installing additional packages. 

\subsection{Librosa}
Librosa is a python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems. It uses different signal processing techniques for visualization of audio signals as well as for feature extraction. \newline

Librosa is structured as a collection of submodules that contains functions for estimating tempo, detecting beat events, visualization, time-domain audio processing, feature extraction and so on.

\subsection{TensorFlow}
TensorFlow is a free and open source software library for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It can be used in a wide variety of programming languages like Python, Javascript and so on. Its flexible architecture allows it to be used across variety of platforms \newline

The features of this library includes
\begin{itemize}
	\item AutoDifferentiation : process of automatically calculating the gradient vector of a model with respect to each of its parameters
	\item Eager execution : operations are evaluated immediately as opposed to being added to a computational graph which is executed later
	\item Losses : For training and accessing models
	\item Metrics : API access to commonly used metrics
\end{itemize}
And more.

\subsection{MongoDB}
MongoDB is a document oriented database platform. It is a NoSQL database program and uses JSON-like documents with optional schema. It is schema less, that is the number of fields, content and size of one document can differ from other documents. The structure of single object is clear and there are no complex joins\newline

MongoDB supports dynamic queries that are as powerful as SQL. It is easily scalable. It provides faster data access since it used internal memory for storing the working set. It can be used for applications involving Big Data, Data Hub, Content Management and Delivery, User Data Management, etc.

\subsection{Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)}
Hypertext refers to the links on the internet. Markup Language is a standardized text-encoding system that is used to control structure and formatting of a text document. HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language that is used as a standard for describing documents on the web. \newline

HTML documents are basic building blocks of the web and they are accessible and interconnected with the help of links. HTML elements are used to build HTML pages. These elements are represented in the form of tags. A tag consists of the element name surrounded by angle brackets "\textless" and "\textgreater". These tags allow document content to be represented in the form of headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images and so on. 

\subsection{Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)}
CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. Presentation includes layout, colors, fonts and so on. It describes how elements should be rendered. \newline

CSS makes it possible to separate content from presentation. This allows more flexibility and control to describe presentation characteristics. It also makes it possible to use the same formatting for different documents. Writing CSS separately in a .css file reduces repetitive code and allows it to be cached for faster load speed.  With the help of CSS, the same markup page can be rendered differently.
